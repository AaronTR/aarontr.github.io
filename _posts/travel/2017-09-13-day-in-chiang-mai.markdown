I spent most of the month of August in the Thai city of Chiang Mai and I’d like to tell you all about it. The problem is, writing about my time there has proven difficult.

Every time I sit down and begin to flesh out this post, my mind starts going in a million different directions. How do I present this? What is the purpose of including that? Nothing is clear upstairs. Anything that actually manages to get out of my head and onto the page is muddled and disorganized and that’s not the type of content I’d like to present. How could I possibly have writer’s block when I’m trying to talk about my own life?!

I recently read a book called On Writing by Stephen King. In it he talks about how he approaches writing and the skills you should try to develop in order to succeed at it. One of the things that stood out to me was his focus on the idea of “Writing What You Know”. Not exactly a new idea, but it took me physically holding the words in front of my face to understand. I realized that the reason I was having such a hard time writing about Chiang Mai was because I was ignoring this simple principle.

After all, I’m writing a travel blog aren’t I? I’m supposed to share all the adventure and the drama and the unique insights into local culture. Well what happens if that’s not really what my life is like? I was focusing too much on how I wanted to present myself rather than focusing on just relaying my current reality. Sometimes doing what I’m doing is not incredibly interesting, but there is always something there to write about. It doesn’t matter if it’s what I thought it would be or what I wanted it to be, it matters that it’s real and that I take the time to share it.

So with that lesson in mind, I present to you my Chiang Mai.

<br/><br/>

## My Chiang Mai: Work, Eat, Sleep, Repeat.

For the entirety of my stay in Chiang Mai I lived above a bar that was either called City Bar or Pimmy’s Place. I’m not sure which is the actual name because two signs hung above it. This is that bar and these are the people who own that bar. Pim and Sam. Pim is outgoing and personable. Sam just don’t give a shit.

Most days I would wake up as early as my lazy ass would allow, complete the necessary morning rituals, and meander my way through the maze of narrow alleyways that led to a nearby co-working space. I’ve documented my alleyway stroll for your viewing pleasure.

I’ve never been very good about eating breakfast, but usually I’ll at least make myself grab something to munch on while I work. In Chiang Mai, more often than not, my breakfast was from Smoothies by Carol.

Now to be honest with you, that’s not the name of the place. And I have no idea whether or not this woman’s name is actually Carol. All I know is that she makes a mean banana smoothie. If I could have it for breakfast every day, I probably would.

After grabbing my morning meal, I continue my journey to the co-working space by turning down a street I call “Scooter Street” for obvious reasons.

Just past all the scooters I slip into a side street and, BAM! Temple. 

<div class="post-image-insert">

</div>

[As I’ve mentioned before](https://www.rowemin-around.com/blog/top-5-best-se-asia/), you can’t go more than a couple blocks without seeing one. Not all of them are grand and majestic, though. This temple is small, nestled away in a quiet neighborhood alley. The tackiness of this temple always fascinated me. It’s gaudy and out of place. It’s extremely glittery and always has a sign staked in the front yard advertising foot massages. If you happen to pass by at night, you’ll notice an eerie green glow illuminating the Buddha inside, making him look like the Wizard of Oz. Nevertheless, there are often monks either cleaning or meditating inside so I suppose it’s just as functional as the rest of them.

I continue past the temple and a block later I’m at the co-working space. It’s called Punspace.

Odd name, but it’s a nice place to work. Great internet connection, free coffee and snacks, and real life human coworkers. Well kinda. We all do our own thing, but at least everyone’s in the same boat and willing to chat about it.

This is the room where I worked.

Many days, I would wake up, come here, and stay all day, leaving only for lunch and dinner. This room houses the majority of my Chiang Mai memories.

So what exactly did I do here? Well, for starters, I worked. As I’ve mentioned I am now a freelance web developer which means I have a ton of freedom. This is great for mobilizing my work, but it’s not always so great for productivity. I can go wherever I want whenever I want, but I can go wherever I want whenever I want. Not so easy to manage when you’re in a beautiful foreign country. Chiang Mai was my chance to buckle down and discipline myself. I spent much of my time experimenting with new work schedules and figuring out how to best structure my day around having to be online to meet with coworkers on weekdays from 8p.m. to 11p.m. Not the most fun part of my job, I’ll tell you that.

I also had to re-educate myself on how to manage my finances. When you travel long term you spend a lot of time managing money. This meant spending a disproportionate amount of my time creating budgets, reviewing the reasons I wasn’t able to stick to those budgets, revising budgets, and reassuring credit card companies that yes, in fact, I did buy a new pair of headphones in Bangkok last week. Then there’s purchasing airfare and visa applications and all the other travel expenses that I have to deal with now. It was here that I learned this whole planning and managing thing takes up a larger chunk of time than I expected.

Then there was trying to manage my personal time. There’s so much I’d like to learn, and so many personal projects I’d like to complete. Of course I had the blog. It never quite looks the way I’d like it to so there’s always something to tweak there. Then there was writing for the blog. A blog is pretty worthless without content right? I also had to try to learn a little Thai. It gets really old being unable to read things or understand people, and I’ve always wanted to learn a foreign language. Finally, there was trying to figure out how to best proceed with funding future travel. Should I continue programming? Do I want to? What are my other options? What are my best options? So a portion of my time was I was spent researching these options and discussing them with my “coworkers”.

When all of that working and planning and scheduling and writing was done, I would usually trudge back to City Bar, a.k.a. Pimmy’s Place, grab a beer or two, and hit the hay for some much needed sleep. After all I have to get up and do it again tomorrow.

This routine was punctuated by weekend excursions over to the hipster side of town for more beer or a coffee or a very necessary cheeseburger. 

This was my favorite place to get said cheeseburger, the aptly named Damn Good Burger. So greasy, so good. I cannot overstate the importance of cheeseburgers to the acclimatization process.

And this was Beer Lab, my favorite bar.

It’s still the only place I’ve found over here that serves Rogue’s Dead Guy Ale. Plus they play good music and are always showing soccer (football, Aaron, football) matches on large flat screen TVs. Makes that $9 beer almost worth it.

This is my favorite place to go when I wasn’t jonesing for American food. It’s a Thai place called Anchan Noodle. 

<div class="post-image-insert">

</div>

It looks a bit fancier, but it’s super casual and always full of young Thai people looking to eat good food for cheap. Best Thai food I had in Chiang Mai and it cost less than five bucks.

Beyond that handful of places, my experience was very limited. As much as I hate to say it, Chiang Mai wasn’t so much of a destination for me as it was a learning process. I wasn’t able to explore the city in the capacity it deserves because I was too focused on managing my time and nailing down the hard bits of my new lifestyle.

Since that month in Chiang Mai I have learned how to better manage my time and step outside the office a bit more. Even now though, two months later, I still struggle with the balance between maintaining my ability to travel and enjoying it to the fullest. This struggle may not always be the most interesting thing to write about, but it’s real and it’s what I have to share. It’s what I know.
